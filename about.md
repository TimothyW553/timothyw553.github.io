Hi there!

My name is Timothy Wang, but you might recognize me by the usernames I use on most websites â€” `TimothyW553`, `Kuais`, or even `CurrentlyKuais`.

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo, class of 2026.

During my time in high school, I spent a lot of time on competitive programming and software development. You can check out my GitHub in the footer below to check out some of the projects I've made over the years.

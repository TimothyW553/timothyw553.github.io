Welcome to my first post!

It's the summer after my grade 12 year and I'm heading off to the University of Waterloo to study Computer Science. As we're all still in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to do something with my time and learn more about software and web development. 

In my future blog posts, I'll be documenting my process of building a web application using the MERN stack. Hopefully, I'll be able to share what works and doesn't work in these blog posts. I might also occassionally talk about competitive programming, as that is something I spent a lot of my time in high school doing.

Hopefully you find these posts useful!

Hi! I'm Timothy! 

I'm a Toronto based student studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. 

Since you're already here, you might be interested in some of the [projects](https://github.com/TimothyW553) I've worked on, 
or perhaps the things I've talked about in my blog below. Maybe, you'd even check out my [resume](/static/Timothy_Wang_Resume.pdf)!

If you'd like to get in touch, you can contact `timothy.art [at] gmail.com`
